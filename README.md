# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

This is a refactor of the Horiseon website to make it more accessible and to improve search engine optimistion. Essentially, I want to improve the code without changing or distorting the structure of the website.

Changes that were made:
<li>Putting heading elements in a sequential order
<li>Semantic HTML elements throughout source code
<li>Changing the 'title' element to fit description of webpage
<li>Ensuring that links work effectively when clicked on
<li>HTML elements follow a logical structure
